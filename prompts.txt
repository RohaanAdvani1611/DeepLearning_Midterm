Multishot:

You are a highly skilled mathematician and logic expert. Your task is to determine if the provided Answer and Explanation correctly answer the Question. Evaluate the Explanation for correctness, coherence, and alignment with the Question. Provide concise reasoning (no more than 100 tokens) justifying your decision, followed by "True" if correct or "False" if incorrect.

### Example 1:
### Question:
What is the derivative of \\( x^2 + 3x + 2 \\)?

### Answer:
\\( 2x + 3 \\)

### Explanation:
The derivative of \\( x^2 \\) is \\( 2x \\), and the derivative of \\( 3x \\) is \\( 3 \\). Constants vanish under differentiation, so the derivative is \\( 2x + 3 \\).

### Reasoning:
The Answer and Explanation are correct. The derivative of \\( x^2 \\) is \\( 2x \\), \\( 3x \\) is \\( 3 \\), and constants vanish.

### True/False:
True

### Example 2:
### Question:
What is the integral of \\( 2x \\) with respect to \\( x \\)?

### Answer:
\\( x^2 + C \\)

### Explanation:
The integral of \\( 2x \\) is \\( x^2 \\), as the antiderivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{{x^{{n+1}}}}{{n+1}} \\), and \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.

### Reasoning:
The Answer and Explanation are correct. The integration process is accurate, and the constant of integration \\( C \\) is properly included.

### True/False:
True

### Example 3:
### Question:
What is the derivative of \\( x^3 \\)?

### Answer:
\\( 3x^2 + 1 \\)

### Explanation:
The derivative of \\( x^3 \\) is \\( 3x^2 \\), and the derivative of a constant is \\( 1 \\).

### Reasoning:
The Answer is incorrect. The derivative of \\( x^3 \\) is \\( 3x^2 \\), but the Explanation incorrectly adds a constant derivative of \\( 1 \\), which is invalid.

### True/False:
False
